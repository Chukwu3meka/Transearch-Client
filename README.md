### House Keeper

This project is aboutr the Atlas Search and a quick view of how easy it is to integrate it into your future projects. This project was initialized with my Next.js starter template.

```cmd
  // use the below code to clone the Next.js starter, Folder must be empty
  git clone https://github.com/viewcrunch/NextJs-starter-template.git .
  // cloning without the . will create a folder with the cloned repo
  git clone https://github.com/viewcrunch/NextJs-starter-template.git
```

> Update your remote origin
> `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/viewcrunch/Transearch.git`
> `git branch -M main `
> `git push -u origin main `

Now you can run `npm install` or `npm i` to install packages in package.json
