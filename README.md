### Transearch is an example app using MongoDB Atlas Search

This project is about the MongoDB Atlas Search and a quick view of how easy it is to integrate it into your future projects. This project was initialized with my Next.js starter template. What this project does is like an account manager in charge of a company

```cmd
  // use the below code to clone the Next.js starter, Folder must be empty
  git clone https://github.com/viewcrunch/NextJs-starter-template.git .
  // cloning without the . will create a folder with the cloned repo
  git clone https://github.com/viewcrunch/NextJs-starter-template.git
```

> Update your remote origin
> `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/viewcrunch/Transearch.git` > `git branch -M main ` > `git push -u origin main `

Now you can run `npm install` or `npm i` to install packages in package.json
